This website hosts the violin repertoire web corpus as a long-lasting MIR dataset and a collection of reference recordings for the use in violin training. Its main purpose is the easy exploration and identification of the links, which sometimes can get disappear. All rights of the content belong to the original performers, who are also in general the channel owners on YouTube.

The current public version includes the previously published violin performance recordings [that correspond to the MIDI files shared in the violin transcription work](https://github.com/MTG/violin-transcription/tree/main/dataset). These can be accessed under the Etudes tab, and categorized with composer and opus numbers. For example, [Etudes/Kayser/Kayser, Op. 20 No. 5](https://nctamer.github.io/violin-repertoire/docs/Etudes/Kayser_Op20-05).

A private version hosts the performances with difficulty and technique labels, and corresponds to a much larger corpus of 443 etudes and 419 solo pieces. This version is not publicised since the corresponding experiments and paper are not finished. An example page for this version can be accessed here for [Rode, Op. 22 No. 1](https://nctamer.github.io/violin-repertoire/docs/etudes/Rode/Rode_Op22-01.html). The private repo and page can be shared with the thesis committee upon request.
